Features

Start and Stop the Timer
Display the Elapsed Time
User-Friendly Interface

Requirements

Python 3.x
Tkinter (Comes with Python)

Installation

Ensure Python is installed.
Run the kronometre.py file

Usage

Run the kronometre.py file to start the program.
Click the "Start" button to start the timer.
Click the "Stop" button to stop the timer.

Technologies Used in the Code and Learnings

This project uses the following Python technologies and libraries:

Tkinter: The standard library in Python for creating graphical interfaces. Used in this project for buttons, labels, and general UI elements.
Threading: The module used in Python to create multiple threads. Used in this project to update the timer while starting and stopping the timer.
Time: The module used for time operations. Used in this project to get the start time of the timer and calculate the elapsed time.

What I Learned

Creating a Simple GUI Application with Tkinter
Creating Background Tasks Using Threading
Performing Time Operations with the Time Module
Using Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
